# Arduinoscope
My attempt to motorize my 8inch Dobsonian. Works fine with Stellarium. Motors are 27:1 Planetary Gearbox Nema 17s. Go to via bluetooth in Stellarium and object tracking is slightly off, probably because the gears and belts are not super high tolerance.

//TODO - Describe Parts List, Circuit diagrams, add photos, etc.
